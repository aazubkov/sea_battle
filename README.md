# Actually code was given in the presentation, so the game is based on that code
# However, it was updated a bit on my own:
# 1) Uncluded Russian / English languages versions
# 2) Increased AI's IQ: it doesn't shoot on unavailable cells to prevent BoardUsedException on its turns
# 3) Increased AI's IQ: it understands when a User's Ship is under fire and try to kill it hitting on surroundings
# 4) Option for manual placing of Ships on Board added for User
# 5) Board's size 6x6 or 9x9 option added
